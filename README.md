# final-repository

Lily and Kasturi are looking at pollution in Delhi for our final project, and we're interested in its health & social implications. 
a) There's been articles and research linking Delhi air to miscarriages. b) Schools have had to shut down to prevent children from being exposed to it. 

What we have in here is a csv scraped off this site: https://aqicn.org/city/delhi/, which runs on data provided by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee. Our data is averages of PM 2.5 measurements in the air for each day going as far back as Dec 2018; there are some missing values. The tldr of basic analysis here is that pollution is worse over the winter, largely due to farming practices in the states neighboring the capital. We're interested in visualizing this using stills from a cricket match last week, one that organizers were under a fair amount of pressure to cancel. High levels — as seen last week — have tangible effects on visibility.

I will scrape all the school days lost to pollution by the end of the day. We requested National Family Health Survey data, which came through, but pandas can't seem to open it — it seems to be too big? Would love your help on this — github says the file is too big for this repository.   

Update:
This is rough because the webpage that hosted AQI data for the government was down all weekend, and just got up and running Monday morning Indian time (which is Sunday here).

For this version, we're just sticking with school days and pollution. You can find a link to the webpage here.
