# final-repository

Lily and Kasturi are looking at pollution in Delhi for our final project, and we're interested in its health implications. There's been articles and research linking Delhi air to miscarriages. Schools have had to shut down to prevent children from being exposed to it. 

What we have in here is a csv scraped off this site: https://aqicn.org/city/delhi/, which runs on data provided by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee. We're interested in visualizing this using stills from a cricket match last week, one that organizers were under a fair amount of pressure to cancel. High levels — as seen last week — have tangible effects on visibility.

I will scrape all the school days lost to pollution by the end of the day. We requested National Family Health Survey data, which came through, but pandas can't seem to open it.
